# Olfactory bulb model with sister mitral cells
- Code to reproduce the simulations and figures in Tootoonian et al. 2021.
## Requirements
- Code was written and tested using Python 3.8.5 provided by Anaconda.
- Other versions/distributions of Python 3.8+ should also work with minimal modification.
- This code requires [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/). This can be installed using `pip install cvxpy`.
- This code also requires `tqdm` progress monitor, which can be installed using `pip install tqdm`
- This code was written and tested on CentOS Linux 7.
- Some of the simulations and analyses require large amounts of RAM, 64 GB is recommended.
## Basic setup
- Download this repository to a directory of your choice.
- Set an environment variable `SISTER_MCS` to this top level folder.
- Create a folder at a location of your choice, and set environment variable `SISTER_MCS_DATA` to this folder.
- To test the code, navigate to `$SISTER_MCS/code/test` 
- Run `./run.sh`.
- This will run a basic instance of the model.
- Once the run is complete, process the results using `python proc.py`
- This will create `proc.pdf`, showing some of the outputs.
## Code structure
- Most of the code is in the `code` subfolder.
- The file containing the olfactory bulb model is [olfactory_bulb.py](code/olfactory_bulb.py).
- An example of basic usage of the model can be found in the `create_and_run_olfactory_bulb` in [datatools.py](code/datatools.py).
### Sweeps
- To test the model at different parameter setting we ran several sweeps.
- The default parameters around which the model was tested are in [default_params.json](default_params.json).
- The parameters for each sweep were generated by a corresponding `gen_jobs_XYZ.py` script.
- Each script generates:
  - The folder to contain the sweep.
  - A number of JSON files, prefixed `params` and each containing the parameter settings for a single run of the model.
  - Shell scripts that create SLURM jobs for running the model for subsets of the parameter files using [run_sisters.py](code/run_sisters.py).
- `run_sisters.py` creates a subfolder e.g. `params123` where it stores the model output for `params123.json`.
- The data for the paper were generated using the following sweeps:
  - [gen_jobs_S_k_sweep.py](code/gen_jobs_S_k_sweep.py)
    - The number of sisters `S` was varied from 1 to 25
    - The number of molecules in the true odor `k` was varied from 1 to 10.
    - 20 runs per parameter setting.
    - `dt = 1e-6`
    - Results stored in `sweep_S_k`.
    - Used by [effect_of_sisters.py](code/effect_of_sisters.py).
